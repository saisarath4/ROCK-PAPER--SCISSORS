# ROCK-PAPER--SCISSORS

The Rock-Paper-Scissors Game is a timeless hand game usually played between two people. It is often used as a decision-making tool or simply for fun. In this project, we implement a digital version of the game, where the player competes against the computer. This project serves as a foundational programming exercise to learn decision-making, randomness, input handling, and user interaction.
